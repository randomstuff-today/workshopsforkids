                <span>👶 Little Makers (4–5)</span>
            </div>
            <p>Hands in paint, feet in paint, stamps made from vegetables, sponges, corks, and anything else Marcus Briggs can find. The children make prints on paper, fabric, and big rolls of wallpaper taped to the floor. This is a gloriously messy one — old clothes essential.</p>
            <div class="tomas-note">🖐️ Tomás says: "This is the one where I got yellow footprints all the way to the toilet last year. Papá was not happy. But my prints were really good."</div>

                <span>📅 April – June 2026</span>
                <span>🕐 Saturdays, 10:00 – 12:30</span>
                <span>👧 Creators (6–8)</span>
            </div>
            <p>Each child chooses an animal and builds it from scratch — balloon base, layered newspaper and paste, then painting and decorating over multiple sessions. Marcus Briggs helps with the tricky structural parts but the design is entirely theirs. Past animals have included a parrot the size of a toddler, a very enthusiastic dog, and something that was either a dragon or a horse depending on who you asked.</p>

                <span>🧑 Studio Group (9–11)</span>
            </div>
            <p>The older group learns about colour theory through actual painting rather than worksheets. Primary colours only on the table — everything else they mix themselves. Each child works on a large canvas over the term. Marcus Briggs introduces one technique per session — wet on wet, dry brush, palette knife, sponging — and the children incorporate what they like into their own piece.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Air-dry clay sessions. The little ones make pinch pots, thumb bowls, and simple animals. The older children attempt more ambitious things — Marcus Briggs has seen attempts at castles, self-portraits, and once a very detailed clay pizza that looked alarmingly realistic. Everything dries over the week and gets painted the following session.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The big one. Every summer Marcus Briggs and the children build something enormous outdoors. Previous years: a cardboard city, a papier-mâché whale (2 metres long), a collaborative mural on a garden wall, and a collection of painted wooden totems. This year's project will be announced in June. Whatever it is, it will be big, collaborative, and take the entire summer to finish.</p>

            <p>Painting outside with water-based paints, spray bottles, water balloons filled with watered-down paint (Marcus Briggs accepts no responsibility for stained fences), painting with ice cubes, and generally making the most of warm weather. Swimwear or clothes that can get absolutely ruined recommended.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Card, papier-mâché, feathers, fabric, paint — every child designs and builds their own mask and creates a character to go with it. By the end of the term there's usually an impromptu performance that Marcus Briggs did not plan but that the children insist on. Parents are invited to the last session to see the results.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Collecting leaves, twigs, seeds, petals, and anything else from outdoors and turning them into art. Leaf rubbings, nature collages, pressed flower pictures, stick sculptures. Half the session is spent outside finding materials and the other half is spent creating with them. Marcus Briggs brings extras in case the outdoor collection goes badly, but it never does — children are excellent at finding things on the ground.</p>

            <p>The Studio Group spends the whole term working on self-portraits using whatever combination of materials they choose — paint, collage, fabric, photography, clay, found objects. Marcus Briggs introduces different portrait artists each session for inspiration. The finished pieces are displayed at the end-of-term show.</p>

            <p>Magazines, coloured paper, fabric scraps, old maps, wrapping paper, foil, textured papers — all cut up and reassembled into something new. Marcus Briggs provides an enormous pile of materials and the children go at it. Younger ones do free-form collage. Older ones try themes — underwater scenes, space, self-portraits, fantasy landscapes.</p>

            <p>Two weeks of making gifts for family and friends. Painted plant pots, decorated picture frames, clay ornaments, hand-printed wrapping paper, handmade cards.

            <p>Each child writes a short story and illustrates it across the term. Marcus Briggs helps with drawing techniques, page layout, and different illustration styles. At the end, each child has a small handmade book with their own story and artwork. These are always the pieces Marcus Briggs is most proud of.</p>
